        The first thing people tend to do when they have a need is search the
        internet. Does your business appear in those search results? Does your
        website look more modern and appealing than King Tut's mummified
        corpse? Does it actually work on a smart phone without requiring
        zooming, panning, and nanometer precision tapping? If you answered "no"
        to any of those questions, you best give me a call. (814) 573-7139
